## Layman Summary

This research explores whether a statistical property from repeated language-model sampling can predict when voting improves accuracy—and documents foundations in voting theory, power-law mathematics, and LLM behavior needed to test this hypothesis.

## Full Summary

This research synthesizes five critical knowledge domains to establish theoretical and methodological foundations for testing whether Taylor's power-law exponent (b), computed from repeated LLM sampling, can serve as a diagnostic for when majority voting helps LLM accuracy.

**Voting Theory Foundation (de Finetti & Non-Monotone Curves):** Classical voting theory assumed monotone behavior, but recent work shows voting can help, hurt, or reverse direction depending on latent correctness distribution. De Finetti representation for exchangeable repeated correctness reveals voting curves determined by per-example success-probability distribution. Signed voting signatures uniquely characterize voting behavior. Critical finding: when per-problem correctness < 0.5, majority voting amplifies errors. Two-call theory predicts voting gain from just mean and second moment without large-scale sampling [1, 2].

**Taylor's Law in Ecology & Universality:** Taylor's power law (Var = a * Mean^b) from 1961 ecology relates population variance to mean through power law. Exponent b ∈ [0.8, 2.0] typically; b ≈ 1 indicates Poisson/independence; b > 1 indicates clustering from shared drivers. Confirmed across hundreds of species. In linguistics, applied to 1100+ texts across 14 languages yielding universal b ≈ 0.58 for written text, 0.63 adult speech, 0.68 child speech, 0.79 code/music [3, 4, 5]. Cross-domain consistency suggests Taylor's law captures fundamental system properties [5].

**LLM Error Correlation (Non-Independence):** LLM errors are NOT independent—they are substantially correlated, with accurate models showing higher correlation than weaker ones [6]. This violates Poisson assumptions underlying classical voting theory. Variance decomposes into within-prompt resampling (~35%), prompt paraphrase, model identity, language choice; systematic factors dominate [7]. Temperature affects consistency/diversity but not per-call accuracy [8, 9]. Standard sampling protocol: fixed temperature 0.7-0.8, N=20-30 samples per problem [19, 20].

**Error Diversity Predicts Voting Benefit:** Intra-group error diversity (how dispersed wrong answers are) strongly predicts voting gain—problems with diverse wrong answers benefit more from aggregation [10]. Embedding-based clustering has known limitations (anisotropy, low geometric separation, semantic ambiguity) but alternative methods exist (syntactic, entailment-based) [11, 12]. For mechanistic validation, entropy of wrong-answer distribution should track Taylor's exponent: high-b problems (clustered errors) should show lower entropy [10].

**Voting Aggregation Methods & Metrics:** Two-call theory yields distribution-free voting accuracy intervals at any budget k (k=3, 5, 10) with width ≤ 1/8 [2]. Ranked voting offers modest gains over plurality [13]. Confidence-weighted voting best when calibrated [13]. Advanced methods (Optimal Weight, Inverse Surprising Popularity) leverage higher-order information and provably exceed majority voting [13]. Voting saturates quickly; pass@k continues improving [1, 2].

**Benchmarks & Difficulty Stratification:** GSM8K (8.5K problems, easy 91.2% accuracy, hard 66.7%) [14]; MMLU (57 domains, 4-level difficulty) [14]; MATH (competition-level, hardest Level 5) [14]. Combined span 66.7%-91.2% accuracy, enabling difficulty-stratified testing [14]. All available on HuggingFace with open licenses [21].

**Computational Budget & Model Selection:** OpenRouter offers 300+ models [16]. Budget for $10: 1,000 problems × 20-30 samples ≈ $5-7.50 cost. Recommended mix: 1× small (7B), 1× mid (13-32B), 1× large (70B+) for transfer testing [16].

**Taylor's Law Operationalization:** Log-log regression on (log mean, log variance) across problems yields exponent b with 95% CI [17]. Bernoulli variance v_p = m_p(1 - m_p) where m_p = correctness mean [18]. Edge case handling: exclude m_p = 0 or 1 (zero variance); log(0) carefully [17].

**Hypothesis & Success Criterion:** High b (≥ 1.5) proxies correlated errors → low voting gain. Low b (≈ 1.0) proxies independent errors → high voting gain. Spearman ρ test: |ρ| > 0.5, p < 0.05 [1, 2]. Must transfer to held-out (model, benchmark, difficulty) combinations. Mechanistic probe: entropy of wrong answers in high-b problems should be lower than low-b [10].

**Novel Gap:** No published work applies Taylor's law to LLM sampling to predict voting gain. This cross-domain hypothesis offers a cheap, pre-registered diagnostic (compute b once, predict voting benefit) vs. post-hoc voting comparison.
